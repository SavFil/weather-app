# weather-app
Weather-app is a web application that gets your location data and passes it to an express server. The server uses the Dark Sky API(weather) and OpenAQ (open air quality) database.  You can view your checkins written from the contextual data collected from the application. The data includes your location, the weather, and the air polltion in the area if there are measurements available.

This app is for learning purposes and is based on [Intro-to-Data-APIs-JS](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Intro-to-Data-APIs-JS ) from [CodingTrain](https://github.com/CodingTrain )
